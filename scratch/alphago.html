    <p>Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search. David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris J.

Nature, Vol 529. January 28, 2016.</p>
<p>In a perfect-information game, there is some optimal value function <mathjax>$v^*(s)$</mathjax> for a given state <mathjax>$s$</mathjax> that holds when all players play perfectly.</p>
<p>A search space may be too large to fully expand to terminal nodes. There are two techniques for reducing this search space:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <em>depth</em> can be reduced truncating the search tree under state <mathjax>$s$</mathjax> and using an approximate value function <mathjax>$v(s) \approx v^*(s)$</mathjax> for that state.</li>
<li>The <em>breadth</em> can be reduced by sampling moves (actions) from a learned policy <mathjax>$p(a|s)$</mathjax> (a probability distribution over possible actions <mathjax>$a$</mathjax> from state <mathjax>$s$</mathjax>) rather than exhaustively considering every possible move from that state.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>Monte Carlo rollout</em> searches the complete depth of a tree, but along a single branch; that is, at each step it samples one move from the policy and extends the tree with that.</p>
<p><em>Monte Carlo Tree Search</em> (MCTS) uses such multiple rollouts to value each state.</p>
<p>AlphaGo has three policy (neural) network and a value (neural) network.</p>
<p>The three policy networks are:</p>
<ol>
<li>a supervised learning policy network, <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax>, which is a convolutional neural network</li>
<li>a simple linear softmax policy network, <mathjax>$p_{\pi}$</mathjax>, which is less accurate than <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax> but much faster</li>
<li>a reinforcement learning policy network <mathjax>$p_{\rho}$</mathjax>, which has the same architecture as <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax> and has weights initialized from <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax> as well (basically, it is a copy of <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax> that is improved through reinforcement learning)</li>
</ol>
<p><mathjax>$p_{\rho}$</mathjax>'s reward function <mathjax>$r(s)$</mathjax> is zero for all non-terminal time steps. It is trained from randomly selected previous iterations of itself (so as to avoid overfitting to a particular opponent policy).</p>
<p>Typically, the approximate value function <mathjax>$v(s)$</mathjax> is just a linear combination of features. Here, a neural network is used instead - in particular, a convolutional neural network with the same architecture as <mathjax>$p_{\sigma}$</mathjax>, but outputs a single prediction rather than a distribution.</p>
<p>See the paper for more details on how each of these networks are trained.</p>
<p>The policy networks and value networks are then used as parts of Q-Learning.</p>
