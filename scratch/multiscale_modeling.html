    <p>notes from <a href="http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/Multiscale.pdf">Coarse graining and multiscale techniques</a>. M. Scott Shell.</p>
<p>The world can be modeled across multiple scales. Running a simulation of, say, a society is not computationally feasible if working from first principles - e.g. you can't take a simulation of individual atomic interactions and scale it out to simulate a full human society. Rather, you'd just model the latter with only as much detail as is needed to capture the interesting phenomena at that level.</p>
<p>Dealing with these kinds of scenarios in which we are interested in phenomena that happen at various scales is a problem of <em>multiscale modeling</em>. Models for the higher-levels of the systems we are interested in are called <em>coarse-grained</em> models.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two methods for building these multiscale models:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>bottom-up</em>, in which lower-level simulations are used to parameterize higher-level models</li>
<li><em>top-down</em>, in which higher-level simulations are used to parameterize lower-level models</li>
</ul>
<p>In the bottom-up case, you could group elements at the lower-level into abstracted elements at the higher-level, e.g. at a lower-level look at the individuals in a neighborhood, at a higher-level consider the neighborhood as a single entity.</p>
<p>Multiscale modeling won't work if the system is very sensitive to small changes.</p>
<p>Multiscale simulation: like if you're zoomed into a city block, you want to see all the detail there, once you zoom super far out, you don't need to see the individuals anymore.</p>
