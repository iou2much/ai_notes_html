    <p>notes from University of Vermont's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAuiGdPEdw0jySMqCxj2-BQ5QKM9ts8ik">Evolutionary Robotics course</a> (CS206, Spring 2016), taught by Josh Bongard</p>
<p>General approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a task environment</li>
<li>create the robot</li>
<li>create a neural net as the robot's "brain"</li>
<li>use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the neural net for the task</li>
</ol>
<p>Some previously evolved behavior for one purpose may later find new use for another purpose. This is called <em>exaptation</em>.</p>
<p><em>Embodied</em> cognition involves learning through interaction - the agent manipulates its environment, observes the consequence, and learns from that. A "body" here refers to a tool that can affect and be affected by the world. The general idea behind embodied cognition is that the way you process information is affected by your body.</p>
<p><em>Situated</em> cognition is similar to embodied cognition, which says that the way you process information is affected by the fact that you are physically situated in the world (i.e. you have a bunch of sensors).</p>
<p>A <em>complete agent</em> is one that is both situated and embodied. There are some important properties that distinguish complete agents from other kinds of agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are subject to the laws of physics</li>
<li>they generate sensory stimulation (through behavior)</li>
<li>they affect the environment (through behavior)</li>
</ul>
