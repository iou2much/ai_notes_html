    <h1>Graphs</h1>
<p>A <strong>graph</strong> consists of <strong>vertices</strong> (nodes) connected by <strong>edges</strong> (arcs).</p>
<p>The two main categories of graphs are <strong>undirected</strong> graphs, in which edges don't have any particular direction, and <strong>directed graphs</strong>, where edges have direction - for example, there may be an edge from node A to node B, but no edge from node B to node A.</p>
<figure><img alt="A directed graph" src="../assets/directed.svg" /><figcaption>A directed graph</figcaption>

<figure><img alt="An undirected graph" src="../assets/undirected.svg" /><figcaption>An undirected graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Generally, we use the following notation for a graph <mathjax>$G$</mathjax>: <mathjax>$n$</mathjax> is the number of vertices, i.e. <mathjax>$|V|$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$m$</mathjax> is the number of edges, i.e. <mathjax>$|E|$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Within undirected graphs there are other distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>simple</em> graph is a graph in which there are no loops and only single edges are allowed</li>
<li>a <em>regular</em> graph is one in which each vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e. the same degree)</li>
<li>a <em>complete</em> graph is a simple graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge</li>
<li>a <em>connected</em> graph is a graph where there exists a path between every pair of vertices</li>
</ul>
<p>For a connected graph with no parallel edges (i.e. each pair of vertices has only zero or one edge between it), <mathjax>$m$</mathjax> is somewhere between <mathjax>$\Omega(n)$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$O(n^2)$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Generally, a graph is said to be <strong>sparse</strong> if <mathjax>$m$</mathjax> is <mathjax>$O(n)$</mathjax> or close to it (that is, it has the lower end of number of edges). If <mathjax>$m$</mathjax> is closer to <mathjax>$O(n^2)$</mathjax>, this is generally said to be a <strong>dense</strong> graph.</p>
<p>An adjacency matrix requires <mathjax>$\Theta(n^2)$</mathjax> space. If the graph is sparse, this is a waste of space, and an adjacency list is more appropriate - you have an array of vertices and an array of edges. Each edge points to its endpoints, and each vertex points to edges incident on it. This requires <mathjax>$\Theta(m+n)$</mathjax> space (because the array of vertices takes <mathjax>$\Theta(n)$</mathjax> space and the arrays of edges, edge-to-endpoints, and vertex-to-edges each take <mathjax>$\Theta(m)$</mathjax>, for <mathjax>$\Theta(n+3m) = \Theta(m+n)$</mathjax>), so it is better for sparse graphs.</p>
<p>Consider the accompanying example graph.</p>
<figure><img alt="Example graph" src="../assets/graph_example.svg" /><figcaption>Example graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <strong>path</strong> <mathjax>$A \to B$</mathjax> is the sequence of nodes connecting <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> to <mathjax>$B$</mathjax>, including <mathjax>$A$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$B$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>Here the path <mathjax>$A \to B$</mathjax> is <mathjax>$A,C,E,B$</mathjax>.</p>
<p><mathjax>$A,C,E$</mathjax> are the <strong>ancestors</strong> of <mathjax>$B$</mathjax>.<br />
<mathjax>$C,E,B$</mathjax> are the <strong>descendants</strong> of <mathjax>$A$</mathjax>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Example of a cyclic graph" src="../assets/graph_cycle_example.svg" /><figcaption>Example of a cyclic graph</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <strong>cycle</strong> is a directed path which ends where it starts. Here, <mathjax>$A,D,C,B$</mathjax> form a cycle.</p>
<p>A <strong>loop</strong> is any path (directed or not) which ends where it starts.</p>
<p>A graph with no cycles is said to be <strong>acyclic</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>chord</strong> is any edge which connects two non-adjacent nodes in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>Directed acyclic graphs</strong> (DAGs) are used often. In a DAG, <strong>parents</strong> are the nodes which point to a given node; the nodes that a given node points to are its <strong>children</strong>. A <strong>family</strong> of a node is the node and its parents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Markov blanket</strong> of a node is its parents, children, and the parents of its children (including itself).</p>
<p>For an undirected graph, a node's <strong>neighbors</strong> are noes directly connected to it.</p>
<p>In an undirected graph, a <strong>clique</strong> is a fully-connected subset of nodes. All members of a clique are neighbors.</p>
<p>A <strong>maximal clique</strong> is a clique which is not a subset of another clique.</p>
<figure><img alt="A graph demonstrating cliques" src="../assets/clique_example.svg" /><figcaption>A graph demonstrating cliques</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this graph:</p>
<ul>
<li><mathjax>$\{A,B,C,D\}$</mathjax> is a maximal clique</li>
<li><mathjax>$\{B,C,E\}$</mathjax> is a maximal clique</li>
<li><mathjax>$\{A,B,C\}$</mathjax> is a non-maximal clique, contained in <mathjax>$\{A,B,C,D\}$</mathjax></li>
</ul>
<p>An undirected graph is <strong>connected</strong> if there is a path between every pair of nodes. That is, there is no isolated subgraph.</p>
<p>For a non-connected graph, its <strong>connected components</strong> are its subgraphs which are connected.</p>
<p>A <strong>singly connected graph</strong> is the connected graph (directed or not) where there is only one path between each pair of nodes. This is equivalent to a <strong>tree</strong>.</p>
<p>A non-singly connected graph is said to be <strong>multiply connected</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>spanning tree</strong> of an undirected graph is one where the sum of all edge weights is at least as large as any other spanning trees'.</p>
<figure><img alt="Spanning tree example. The graph on the right is a spanning tree of the graph on the left." src="../assets/spanning_tree.svg" /><figcaption>Spanning tree example. The graph on the right is a spanning tree of the graph on the left.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Graphs can be represented as an <strong>adjacency matrix</strong>:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$</mathjax></p>
<p>Where a non-zero value at <mathjax>$A_{ij}$</mathjax> indicates that node <mathjax>$i$</mathjax> is connected to node <mathjax>$j$</mathjax>.</p>
<p>A <strong>clique matrix</strong> represents the maximal cliques in a graph.</p>
<p>For example, this clique matrix describes the following maximal clique:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$</mathjax></p>
<figure><img alt="A maximal clique" src="../assets/maximal_clique.svg" /><figcaption>A maximal clique</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A clique matrix containing only 2-node cliques is an <strong>incidence matrix</strong>:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$</mathjax></p>
